Text Mining with R
================

Description
-----------

This project includes my notes/code for working through Julia Silge and David Robinson's "Text Mining with R" (O'Reilly, 2017). I've also put together an IOSlides presentation to display plots from the book (for the purpose of practicing IOSlides).
