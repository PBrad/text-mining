Text Mining with R
================

Description
-----------

This project includes my notes/code for working through Julia Silge and David Robinson's "Text Mining with R" (O'Reilly, 2017). I've also put together an IOSlides presentation to display plots from the book (for the purpose of practicing IOSlides).

20180103 - Finished Chapter 9 (and the book!) - Overall, does a convincing job of selling the tidy approach to text analysis. As a future project(s), I'm going to pick some text data (likely starting with a book) and performing similar analyses. Beyond just the text analysis, I picked up some nice tricks for use in dplyr and other tidy packages that I had previously been unaware of (e.g., top\_n, aesthetics of some of the graphs, reordering for ggplot in mutate rather than in the aes) and new (to me) packages like widyr. It was also just helpful to read through Julia/David's code to see their "style"/approach.
